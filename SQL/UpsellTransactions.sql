/*
Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold, or in other words, the number of users who bought additional products after their first purchase.

Note: If the customer purchased two things on the same day, that does not count as an upsell, as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.

Example:

Input:

transactions table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
product_id	INTEGER
quantity	INTEGER
Output:

Column	Type
num_of_upsold_customers	INTEGER

*/

with cte as
(
    select  user_id, rank() over(partition by user_id order by created_at)
    as rnk
    from 
    transactions


)

select count(distinct user_id) as num_of_upsold_customers
from cte
where rnk >1
